# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

To run a production version of this app locally, you can use the following commands:

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

This will start the server, and you can typically access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
